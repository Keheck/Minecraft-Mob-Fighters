This is the repository for the Minecraft mod Mob Fighters by Keheck.

This branch contains a work-in-progress version for the latest version of Minecraft. Current WIP: 1.14.4, Forge version 1.14.4-28.2.9

I don't really know how sensitive gralde is across different systems of development (e.g. differing IDEs such as Eclipse and IntelliJ), so I pushed a version featuring the sources, however the project needs to be set up (see README.txt, NOT README.md) for how to set up the project.

This package includes:
* world files so if I run into problems and you came here to help me, you can hop on into a world and try to reproduce it.
* source, data and asset files for obvious reasons.
* License and Credit files from the forge-gradle package, idk why I did that.
